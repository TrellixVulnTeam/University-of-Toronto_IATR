# constant: intermediate fitted values (around y-hat = 0.8) have relatively low 
# variance. Separately, the QQ plot of the residuals (not shown) looks good.

# Q2(c) The slope indicates that for a k-fold increase in age, FEV increases by a 
# factor of k^0.8462. So if age doubles, FEV increases by 80%.
