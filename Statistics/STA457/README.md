# STA457 - Time Series Analysis

## Knowledge Domain
This course provides an introduction to time series analysis with finance applications. The techniques learned in this course can also be applied to other disciplines. After finishing this course, students are expected to gain hands-on knowledge on how to analyze and model time series data. Topics in this course include fundamental concepts of time series, Box-Jenkins methods (ARIMA models), multivariate time series analysis (transfer function model, Vector autoregression, co-integration), and applications of machine learning techniques in time series analysis, such as bootstrapping, bagging and boosting for forecasting time series.

## Personal Summary
The worst course being tought in school. However the time series knowledge is important. Thus, yet another to learn by myself.
