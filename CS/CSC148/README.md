# CSC148 - Introduction to Computer Science

## Knowledge Domain
Abstract data types and data structures for implementing them. Linked data structures. Encapsulation and information-hiding. Object-oriented programming. Specifications. Analyzing the efficiency of programs. Recursion.

## Personal Summary
CSC148 is the course which essentially opens the door of Computer Science world for me. The first moment I access to recursion is fantastic. ADT, Abstract data types, is not hard to understand but very attractive. And when I really get the exposure of complexity in recusion, I feel amazing because I realize the universe could run in a such new way.
