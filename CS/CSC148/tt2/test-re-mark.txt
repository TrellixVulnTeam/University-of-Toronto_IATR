Concisely, and clearly, state what portion of the test was not
correctly marked.

Dear Professor,

I want to make remark request for Q3 which I only get 1 score.

Admittedly, I understand the mistake I made on my TT2.

But I think I am on the right track which is probably worthy more than only 1 score.

My solution is different from TT2 official sample solution which may confused TA.

So I want to add some explanation.

My right solution should look like this:

Firstly, I assign list_.back to variable called new_front, i.e., new_front = list_.back. And I also assign list_.back to current node, i.e., cur = list_.back.

Secondly, use while loop to find the target node which is the node before current node and I connect them.Then after reset the current node, I repeat the process until I find the value or reach the end of the list(the first node of original Linkedlist).

What I did wrong is that I begin the process from opposite order which will lose node at first iteration.

I will really appreciate it if you could reconsider my score of Q3.

Best Regards,
Ruijie Sun
