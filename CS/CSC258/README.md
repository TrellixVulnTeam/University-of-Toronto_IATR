# CSC258 - Computer Organization

## Knowledge Domain
Computer structures, machine languages, instruction execution, addressing techniques, and digital representation of data. Computer system organization, memory storage devices, and microprogramming. Block diagram circuit realizations of memory, control and arithmetic functions. There are a number of laboratory periods in which students conduct experiments with digital logic circuits.

## Personal Summary
Can still recall the painful feeling of verilog... But actually the knowleage of CSC258 is cool. From latches, flip flop, ..., to counter, adder, and ALU. A computer is built up!
