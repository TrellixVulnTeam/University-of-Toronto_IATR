Question 1(a):
Construction: 2pts
Proof of correctness: 2pts

Nearly all students got a correct construction. However, most students made the following
mistake in their proof: they only argued that each flow solution gives us a 
matching satisfying the Conditions (1)-(4) given in the question. 
However, we also need to prove: each solution to the original problem corresponds to 
an (integer valued) flow whose value is the number of applicants assigned to roles in
the solution. I took away 1pt if this argument is missing from your proof.


Question 1(b):
Construction: 4pts
Proof of correctness: 2pts

Similarly to 1(a), most students didn't argue that each solution to the original problem 
corresponds to  an (integer valued) flow whose value is the number of applicants assigned 
to roles in the solution. I took away 1pt if this argument is missing from your proof.


Question 2:
Construction: 4pts
Proof of correctness: 2pts

One common mistake is to use the constraint b_1<=b_2<=...<=b_n. Unfortunately, this is not
yet in the proper form for a linear constraint. Instead, you should use 
b_1<=b_2
b_2<=b_3
....
b_{b-1}<=b_n
I took away 1pt for this mistake.

Another common mistake is to forget arguing that each solution b_1,...,b_n to the problem
corresponds to an LP solution with objective value exactly deviation(b_1,...,b_n). This
is very similar to the mistakes that students made in Question 1. Again I took away 1pt
for this mistake.
