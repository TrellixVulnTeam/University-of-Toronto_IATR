(b) TRUE

If shortest path from s to v is defined then it consists of <= |V|-1 edges. Thus, |V|-1 relaxations of all edges are enough to compute it correctly, and relax operations are safe.

(c) TRUE

Easy to see by Ford-Fulkerson method. First of all, Ford-Fulkerson terminates (since capacities are integers). Each augmenting path has capacity that is a multiple of 5. Thus, the overall flow computed by Ford-Fulkerson  will be a multiple of 5.

Max flow value is 2. If each capacity is increased by 1 then max flow value increases to 4.

(e) TRUE

Increasing some component of b increases the feasible region, which means that there are more solutions to choose from.
