Use dynamic programming to solve the all-pairs shortest paths problem, based
on the idea of restricting path length.

More precisely, to get you started, consider a shortest (minimum-weight) path
from u to v; if the path contains more than one edge, then think about the
sub-path from u to the last vertex before v. This defines a certain recursive
structure on the problem: use this idea to carry out the other steps in a
dynamic programming solution (define an array, give a recurrence relation for
the array values, write an iterative algorithm to compute the array values
bottom-up, use the computed array values to reconstruct an optimum solution --
defining additional array values if necessary).

How does your algorithm compare with the one presented in lecture?
