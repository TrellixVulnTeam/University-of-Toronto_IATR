 1. Consider the following network. [This is tricky to draw in ASCII so I'll
    simply provide all of the information -- you should draw this for
    yourself, with node 'a' above, node 'd' below, and nodes 'b', 'c' in the
    middle, in between 's' and 't'.]

                 edge  capacity
                s -> a    10
                s -> b     8
                s -> d     5
                b -> a     3
                b -> c    10
                b -> d     3
                a -> c     3
                a -> t     5
                d -> c     3
                d -> t    10
                c -> t     8

    (a) Compute a maximum flow in this network, using the Ford-Fulkerson
        algorithm: find augmenting paths and use them to augment the flow, one
        path at a time. For each augmenting path, take the time to write down
        the residual capacity and the resulting augmentation in the flow.

    (b) Consider the cut X_0 = ({s,b,c,d},{a,t}). Identify all forward and all
        backward edges across X_0, then compute the capacity and the flow
        across X_0 (for your maximum flow from part (a)).

    (c) Find a cut in the network above whose capacity is equal to the value
        of your maximum flow (this provides a guarantee that your flow really
        is maximum). Use the algorithm outlined in the proof of the
        Ford-Fulkerson theorem.


 2. Explain carefully how to solve the maximum flow problem in a multi-source,
    multi-sink network -- one where there can be more than one source
    s_1,...,s_k and more than one sink t_1,...,t_l. Justify that your solution
    is correct.
