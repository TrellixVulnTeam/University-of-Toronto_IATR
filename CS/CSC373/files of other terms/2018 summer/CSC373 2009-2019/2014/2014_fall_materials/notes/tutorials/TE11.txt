 1. In class, we defined the notion of approximation ratio for MINimization
    problems, so that the ratio is a real number >= 1.
    Give a precise definition of approximation ratio for MAXimization
    problems, so that the ratio is also a real number >= 1.


 2. Consider the following algorithm to find a small vertex cover in an
    undirected graph G:

        Start with every vertex in C, then for each vertex in turn, remove
        it from C if C - v still covers every edge (G itself is unchanged).

    Show that this algorithm has a non-constant approximation ratio.
    What is the worst-case running time for this algorithm?


 3. (a) Write a natural greedy algorithm to find a small vertex cover in an
        undirected graph G. (Hint: think about the degree of each vertex.)

    (b) What is the worst-case running time of your algorithm?

   *(c) What is the approximation ratio for your algorithm?
