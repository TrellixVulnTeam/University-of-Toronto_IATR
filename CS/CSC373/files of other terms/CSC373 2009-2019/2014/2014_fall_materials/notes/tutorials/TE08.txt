 1. Show that the following TRIANGLE decision problem belongs to P.
        Input:  An undirected graph G = (V,E).
        Question:  Does G contain a "triangle", i.e., a subset of three
            vertices with all edges between them present in the graph?


 2. Show that the following CLIQUE decision problem belongs to NP.
        Input:  An undirected graph G = (V,E) and a positive integer k.
        Question:  Does G contain a k-clique, i.e., a subset of k vertices
            with all edges between them present in the graph?


 3. Determine whether each of the following decision problems belongs to P, NP
    or coNP. Justify your answer.

    (a) UNARY-PRIMES
        Input:  1^n (i.e., a string of '1's of length n).
        Question:  Is n prime?

    (b) SUBSET-SUM
        Input:  A set of positive integers S and a positive integer t.
        Question:  Is there some subset of S whose sum is exactly t?

    (c) NON-ZERO
        Input:  A set of integers S.
        Question:  Does every non-empty subset of S have non-zero sum?
