# CSC373 - Algorithm Design, Analysis & Complexity

## Knowledge Domain
Standard algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, linear programming, randomization, network flows, approximation algorithms. Brief introduction to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete problems, self-reducibility. Additional topics may include approximation and randomized algorithms. Students will be expected to show good design principles and adequate skills at reasoning about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.

## Personal Summary
At the end of CSC373, get an exposure of P and NP question. Also, realize approximation is the most generalized approach to reality. A good course overall.
