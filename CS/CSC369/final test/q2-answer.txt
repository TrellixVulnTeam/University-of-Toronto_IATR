q2: Virtual Memory
(This file contains all information needed for this quesiton)

[2 marks]
a) Describe a memory reference pattern that would cause LRU to achieve a 
low hit rate.

ANSWER:
The reference which is most not recently used appears in the upcoming future traces.

b) Propose an algorithm other than Belady's algorithm that would consistently 
achieve a higher hit rate than LRU (Least Recently Used) on memory reference 
patterns similar to the one you desribed in part a). Explain why it would have
a higher hit rate.


ANSWER:
Use clock algorithm. The reference which is recently used appears in the upcoming future traces.
This will achieve high hit rate as there is a high probability that the recent used will be evicted.

c) Describe the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) behaviour when the 
following code snippet is run for the first time. How many hits and misses 
take place?

Remember to consider both data and instructions.  Assume a 1 KiB page size 
and a 32-entry TLB. State any assumptions you need to make.

int i;
int p[1024];
for(i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {
	p[i] = i;
}

ANSWER:

5 misses take place. The initialized i, p, <, assignment (=), and ++ are missed. 

The remaining are hits. 1024*4 = 4096.
