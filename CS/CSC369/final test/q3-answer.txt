q3: Security (This file contains all information needed to answer the question)

a) Explain briefly how a stack overflow attack works.  Decsribe two operating 
systems mechanisms used to protect against this type of attack.

ANSWER:
A method of overloading a predefined amount of memory storage in a buffer, 
which can potentially overwrite and corrupt memory beyond the bufferâ€™s boundaries.

First mechanism is make stack non-executable.
Second mechanism is enhanced compilers that perform bounds checking

b) Do these mechanisms guarantee that stack overflow attacks cannot happen? 
Explain your answer.

ANSWER:
These cannot guarantee. 
For the first one. Attacker need not inject new code. 
They could use return-to-libc attacks.
They could use overflow stack-allocated buffer to overwrite 
return address with address c lib function. 

For the second one. It also cannot guarantee as it's only a randomization. The effectiveness of space layout randomization is dependent on the entirety of the address space layout remaining unknown to the attacker. If the attacker try many times. They could still manage effective attacks.

c) The three principles of computer security that we touched on are 
confidentiality, integrity, and availabilty. Select one of these principles 
and explain one operating system design feature or mechanism (from CSC369) 
that addresses the principle.

ANSWER:
availabilty.
iN Kernel mode, only privileged insturction can run. 
It prevent unexpected code which will corrupt kernel memory address.
