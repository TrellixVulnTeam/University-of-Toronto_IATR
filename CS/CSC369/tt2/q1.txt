Question 1: Scheduling

Consider a Round Robin (RR) scheduler with a 100-millisecond time quantum.

[2 marks]
(a) Identify and explain two major strengths of the Round Robin approach.
1. Prevent starvation as job will be preempted so that the case one job occupy CPU infinitely won't happen.
2. Compared to other approaches, response time is better since new job have relatively low time to wait.

(b) Describe the major weakness of the Round Robin approach.
If the chosen time quantum is too small, the switching time will overwhelm.


Suppose we change the time quantum to 1 millisecond (instead of 100 milliseconds)

(c) How does this change improve the Round Robin scheduler?
Thus, smaller time quantum will cause IO-bound job run quicker.

(d) In what way does this change make the Round Robin scheduler worse? Explain your answer.

Since the time quantum is so small, the switching time will overwhelm.
