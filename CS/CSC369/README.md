## Personal Summary
Operating system - Notorious course in UofT! Took it once and dropped it and conquered it in the second try! Both the concept and assginment are very hardcore and time consuming. The best thing of this course is that, after completed it, I am confidence to say I know something about operating system and able to see what is going on from OS view! Cool!
