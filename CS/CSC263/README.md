# CSC263 - Data Structures and Analysis

## Knowledge Domain
Algorithm analysis: worst-case, average-case, and amortized complexity. Expected worst-case complexity, randomized quicksort and selection. Standard abstract data types, such as graphs, dictionaries, priority queues, and disjoint sets. A variety of data structures for implementing these abstract data types, such as balanced search trees, hashing, heaps, and disjoint forests.

## Personal Summary
Worked so hard for this CSC263 but got the only B grade in Uoft since the arrival of Professor Faith Ellen(get the same final paper with CSC265 which is overwhelming). Hope this part of memory could become interesting many years later.
