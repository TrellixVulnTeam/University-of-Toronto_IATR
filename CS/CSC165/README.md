# CSC165 - Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science
Note that the files of CSC165 is missing now. I will push them to github after I find them.

## Knowledge Domain
Introduction to abstraction and rigour. Informal introduction to logical notation and reasoning. Understanding, using and developing precise expressions of mathematical ideas, including definitions and theorems. Structuring proofs to improve presentation and comprehension. General problem-solving techniques. Running time analysis of iterative programs. Formal definition of Big-O.

## Personal Summary
CSC165 is the pleace where the concept of Big-O appears. Very proof based course. Without enthusiastic professor David Liu, CSC165 could be a boring couse. So I am lucky to take CSC165 when professor Liu is the instructor. However, this term is relatively hardest one in recent years since David Liu treats it very serisouly (Gave us hard time in final test).
