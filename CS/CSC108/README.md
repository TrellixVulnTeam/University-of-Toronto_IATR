# CSC108 - Introduction to Computer Programming
Note that the files of CSC108 is missing now. I will push them to github after I find them.\

## Knowledge Domain
Programming in a language such as Python. Elementary data types, lists, maps. Program structure: control flow, functions, classes, objects, methods. Algorithms and problem solving. Searching, sorting, and complexity. Unit testing.\

## Personal Summary
CSC108 is the place in the world where I learn my mother programming language - python. 
I can still remember the scene where Professor Jacquieline Smith told us what is for loop and while loop in MB building. Even though the time after CSC108 in uoft is tough, sometimes cold, CSC108 is a warm start.
