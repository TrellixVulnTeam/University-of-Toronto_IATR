# CSC321 - Introduction to Neural Networks

## Knowledge Domain
An introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Backpropagation and automatic differentiation. Architectures: convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks. Methods for improving optimization and generalization. Neural networks for unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

## Personal Summary
Course design is not good. Course speed is too fast to follow. Instructor is trying to cover every small detail in lecture and it make students hard to seize key points.
