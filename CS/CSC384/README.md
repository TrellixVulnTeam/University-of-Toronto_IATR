# CSC384 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Knowledge Domain
Theories and algorithms that capture (or approximate) some of the core elements of computational intelligence. Topics include: search; logical representations and reasoning, classical automated planning, representing and reasoning with uncertainty, learning, decision making (planning) under uncertainty. Assignments provide practical experience, in both theory and programming, of the core topics.

## Personal Summary
The most course design ever seen in uoft. CSC384 trigger my interest about AI, I should take it before 400 level AI courses, like CSC411,CSC412 and CSC413. But anyway, the good thing is I don't miss CSC384 before I graduate. The best part of the course is that it recalls a lot stuff in previous course and show student of how powerful they are and then make further exploration about new algo which is cool. Recently, 2021 Jan, I am try to apply HMM to Bitcoin time series prediciton after I learnt HMM in the end part of CSC384.
