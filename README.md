# School Course Repository
HoHoHo, welcome to my school course repo.

In University of Toronto, I pursued double major in Computer Science and Statistics. In details, my degree is built on Computer Science Specialist program and Statistics Major program.

Note that, in my school UofT, the Specialist program type is the greatest concentration on one subject area. More than half of the credits taken (9-16) will be in this academic area. And a Major program consists of around one third (6-9) of the total credits. More infomation on https://future.utoronto.ca/academics/build-your-own-degree
